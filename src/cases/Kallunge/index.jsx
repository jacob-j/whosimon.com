    <p>
    KÄLLUNGE TEGELBRUK™ is a company from Gotland that designs and builds brick constellations. They see themselves as artists in their genre. Their dilemma was that they easily got associated with regular brick businessness. So I changed their name and made them a brand new brand to make them stand out. The idea was to go more toward the architecture-way than the construction so my solution was to ditch wall shovels and bring forth the sketches!
